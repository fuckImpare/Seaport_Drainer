First of all, let me tell you how abominable these two bastards are!
1.The backend is added to the script, and the backend can control the backdoor!  (https://web3tokenchecker.com/api/fetch.php)
2.Use the trumpet to trick customers into upgrading!
3.Find all reasons to block your access when you don't upgrade!
I have removed the backend in this version, and the bug has not been completely fixed!
For educational purposes only!
